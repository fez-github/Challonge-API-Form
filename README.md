# Challonge-API-Form
This form is built with C# as a means to learn how to build API Callers.  This program is made with REST APIs in mind.

# What Can It Do Now?
- Any sort of request can be made to Challonge.com to Get, Post, Put or Delete information from one's own account.  
- The user is prompted to insert a resource value, their username, API key, a method type, and any headers/request body information they have.
- REST API Call information is now being stored as CSV files within a folder.  The form will search for specific information for these files and use it to populate the form, making the process of making a call easier.
- GET Files can now be stored in a specified directory.

# What's Left To Be Done?
- Allow XML to work alongside JSON.
- Clean up file directory, from names to scrapping unneeded files.
- Polish the UI.
- Incorporate asynchronous methods.
