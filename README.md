# Challonge-API-Form
This form is built with C# as a means to learn how to build API Callers.

# What Can It Do Now?
Any sort of request can be made to Challonge.com to Get, Post, Put or Delete information from one's own account.  
The user is prompted to insert a resource value, their username, API key, a method type, and any headers/request body information they have.

# What's Left To Be Done?
- Allow XML to work alongside JSON.
- Clean up file directory, from names to scrapping unneeded files.
- Polish the UI.
- Create a means of storing GET information.  At the moment it's just displaying the result in a message box.
- Create CSV files with Challonge API Call information, and pre-load the information the user would want depending on what call they wish to make.
- Incorporate asynchronous methods.
