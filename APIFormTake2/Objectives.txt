***Objective***
-Create a tool that allows users to connect to the Challonge API.

***RestSharp***
	-Include asyncs.

***Form***
	-Form allows the user to input the desired tournament, API key, and the method they want to use.
	-Group all API calls according to Challonge documentation(Tournaments, Participants, etc.),
		and have them opened up via dropdown.
		**What to do?
			-Create containers for components to be dynamically added.
	-Provide option for request body.
	-Create an Event Handler and have all buttons invoke async events?  This should allow all procedures to run separately.

***Call Components***
	**Common**
		-Group: Tournaments, Participants, etc.
		-Name: Name of Call, such as Index, Create, etc.
		-Type: Type of Call.(Get, Post, Put)
		-Description: Challonge description of method.
	**Parameters**
		-Must be a two-part field.  Part 1 holds the type of parameter, part 2 holds the value the user would input.
			-How to place this inside the visual call object?
	**What to do?**
		-Create a base class to use for all Calls, and have another initializer class of sorts construct instances of each Call.


-IDK if Dictionary is the best method for storing parameters.  JSON might be the best means, but is it doable?
-Currently built around JSON.  Allow XML.
-Polish UI.
	-Change button icon for getting folder name into a folder.
-Incorporate async methods.
-Rework API Call to choose when to store data.  Can be more than just GET.
-Set up data to be called from CSV files.

***CSV File***
-Parameter Name:
-Parameter Description:
-Call Name:
-Call Method:
-Call URL:

-Not sure how to load in Call data, or initialize classes for them.
